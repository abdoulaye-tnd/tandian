Hi there! I'm a college ([cégep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEGEP)) student who [writes JavaScript chatbots](#my-coding-projects), [helps other projects](#projects-i-am-involved-in), [translates websites](#my-translations), [takes photos](#my-photos), studies,  and [explores online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). You may reach me using [these methods](./contact). Straight outta the metropolis of Shanghai, I currently reside in Montréal.

If you need a job title, that'll be "college student/freelance project maintainer". I just put everything on my website, it's not actually a *resume*.

## My photos

<div class="resize2" id="myElement" style="float:right;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="javascript-flickr-badge.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   jsFlickrBadge(document.getElementById('myElement'), {
       flickrId: '136075370@N04',
       feed: 'user',
       tags: '',
       rows: 4,

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload ~~all~~ some ("Good" ones, due to Flickr's free restrictions) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). I'm currently moving most of my photos to [Zonerama](https://austinhuang0131.zonerama.com). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang). And, of course, these low-quality social media ones goes to my Instagram. See below.

## May I ask some questions?
~~No u.~~ Obviously, sure. You can even comment below to ask even more question, eh?

### Hobbies?
Coding, mapping (or, more professionally, *urban planning*), commenting on local/global affairs, model UN, and listening to some beats (80~90s/country/jazz/blues/memes, also classical/organ remixes) ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. Watches some anime quite rarely (≤3 series per year before college, now I ain't got time to even update this website!). Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports ~~given that me being a not-so-sporty kid~~.

#### Model UN?
<img src="./assets/model_un.jpg" alt="Name tags of attended MUN conferences" align="right" width="300"/>

Model UN is great. Strongly recommended. Even if you're not into politics, this giant social-party atmosphere will pull you into this extravaganza, and also allows you to meet some of the best people you'll ever make friends with! (It is quite expensive though, would like to see it becoming more affordable, but eh.)

### Hardware?
A school-provided (now owned) fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) plus several shared VPS from online people ~~comrades~~ and free services (e.g. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)). That's it.

Oh, and I speak [Shanghainese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese), a dialect of the disappearing Wu language. Let's say that's a *software* in my brain.

### Hey, you look cool. How can I support you?
You can [request my services](/services) or [donate to me](/donate)!

### What other stuff are there on this website?
You can have a look at the [sitemap](/sitemap). Also, don't forget to check out [my friends' work](/reference)!
