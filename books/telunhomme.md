There are multiple ways of installing Hydejack.
The easiest and cleanest way is [via the Starter Kit](#via-starter-kit).
Alternatively, you can use the [Ruby gem](#via-gem).
If you don't mind a cluttered source directory, you can use [the zip file](#via-zip).
Finally, If you know what you are doing, you can [fork the git repository](#via-git).

Buyers of the PRO version should [follow these steps](#pro-version).



## Via Starter Kit
Using the Starter Kit has the advantage of not cluttering your blog repository.
Additionally, it allows you to publish your site on GitHub Pages with a single `push`.

If you have a GitHub account, fork the [hydejack-starter-kit](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack-starter-kit) repository.
Otherwise [download the source files](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack-starter-kit/archive/master.zip)
and unzip them somewhere on your machine.

**NOTE**: In addition to the docs here, you can follow the quick start guide in the starter kit.
