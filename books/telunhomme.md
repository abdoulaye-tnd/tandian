## Thought and character

> As a man thinketh in his heart so is he

- thinking noble and god-like shapes the character over time in this direction
- any level of nobility can be attained simply by the right thoughts
- we are our own masters of thought and therefore shapers of our destiny

## Effect of thought on circumstances

- thoughts have to be cultivated and critically examined
> every man is where he is by the law of his being

- circumstances grow out of one’s own thoughts
- the soul will always attracts which it harbors

> good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit

> Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results

- suffering is the result of one’s mental disharmony
