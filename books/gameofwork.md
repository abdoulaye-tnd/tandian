## Introduction

- Game of work works because it is a process wo do WITH team members not TO team members.
- The five principles of the Motivation 
  - Clearly defined goals 
  - Better scorekeeping and scorecards 
  - More frequent feedback 
  - A higher degree of personal choice of methods 
  - Consistent coaching 
  
## The game of Work 

> People will pay for the privilege of working harder than they will work when they are paid 

-  But why ? WHy do people put up to ten times as much energy and effort into their avocations as into their vocation ? 

- The are several reasons : 

1. In recreation, oals are clearly defined 
  - Shooting a deer, winning a game, beating your previous time. 
  - The desired result is clear and easily measuerd 

1. In recreation the scorekeeping is better because it's more objective, self-administred and dynamic
  - It allows player to compare current personal performance zith past personal performance as well as with an accepted standard 
  - In recreation, everybody knows how to keep score 
  - In golf you get realistic feedback that you can relate to your own past performance. If you were getting feedback on your golf game comparing you to Tiger Woods, you would never win. 
  But accurate feedback related to your own past performance usually gives you enough positive reinforcement to make you to keep playing, to keep improving, to beat your own past performance standards. 
  - You win frequently enough to want to keep playing. 
  - You feel great because you are measuring yourself against your own past performance and winning. 
  - In recreation, the scorekeeping enables you to receive immediate and realistic feedback. You know all the times how you are doing. 
 
 1. In recreation feedback is more frequent. Everyday, everybody needs to know whether they are winning or losing. 
 
 - Fortunately, in most recreationnal activities you don't have ti depend on a boss or supervisor to tell you how you are doing. You knoz what the score is as the game progresses. 
 - The feedback is accurate and frequent -- You know where you stand every time you trhow the ball. And everybody knows how to keep score. 
 - Feedback is the breakfast of champions. People who want to get ahead, who want to win, who want to improve and get the job done -- these people want feedback. 
 - If you don't feedback is important, go count the mirrors in your house. 
 - If you want to improve the quality of performance in any area, you simply improve or increase the frequency of feedback. If you have a problem and you are getting a quarterly report, change it to a monthly report. 
 
 1. In recreation, participants feel they have a higher degree of choice. 
 
 - Think about the words that imply a lack of choice -- Words frequently used in business. Words like " have to" "Should" " Muust"
 - How many times have you heard someone say "I have to go play tennis ?" 
 
 1. In recreation they don't change the rules in the middle of the game 
 
 - In the workplace, when expectations are clearly defined and uncertainty is minimized, it is easier for people to have the satisfaction of meeting expectations 
 
## GOALS 

> In the absence of clearly defined goals, we are forced to concentrate on activity and ultimately become enslaved by it

- If you took the goals out of basketball, you would have ten guys running up and down the floor just dribbling the ball --As we do in business sometimes, but without the ball. 
- Goals are the motivating force in athetics. And in athetics, goals are more clearly defined than in business. 
- Goals are the main reason people will payer for the privilege of working harder than they will work when they are paid. 
- When we walk onto the tennis court, we know the goal is to win. When we go onto a football or soccer field, we know where we have to put ourselves and what our performance has to bo to score. 
We must have that same challenge, that same opportunity, that same motivation when we walk into the office in the morning
- Goals in recreation are clearly defined, and as a result, motivation in recreation is at a higher level than is business. 
- Can we bring the motivation of recreation into the workplace ? Yes 

### Goals must be written 

- People will often avoid writing goals, saying , " I don't need to write anything. I can keep my important goals in my head. I can concentrate on the things that are really meaningful in my life"
But if the people rings in the middle of that conversation and their spouse is on the other end asking them to pick up five items from the supermaket, they say, " HOld it, let me write this down so I won't forget" 
- Goals that are not written are merely whishes
- The is something in the act of writing a goal down that makes it real. 
- Goals that are not written down are easily forgotten or changed. 
- Written goals that reviewed regularly become reality. 
- Unwritten goals cannot be read and reviewed 
- When goals are not written, the power of conditionning through repetition is lost 
- Goals must be written

### Goals must be your own 

- Whose company do I work for ? Mine
- Whose boss do I work force ? Mine
- Whose income am I most concerned about ? Mine 
- Whose goals are the most important to me ? Mine 

- Goal setting and goal striving become truly effective only when team or corporate goals become the same as personal goals -- When it becomes my team or my company

### Goals must be positive 

- The goal in sports is not to avoid a loss or defeat 
- Rather than have the negative goal to quit smoking, someone who wants to stop must have a goal to become a nonsmoker
- Nonsmokers have tremendous benefits. 
  - They get lower rates on life and car insurance
  - Their clothes last longer 
  - They don't ruin furniture or carpets 
  - Their smell is not offensive to others 
  - They are non-smokers, a positive thing to be 
- The problem is that most people who quit smoking still see themselves as smokers on vacation or on the wagon, and it is just a matter of time until they start up again. 
- The same principle applies to losing weight
- In basketball and football they count the points you score, not the ones you miss
- You must be able to visualize the goal and the only way the goal can be visual is if it is positive. 
- Instead of a negative goal in pouds, kilogramms that need to be lost, the goal must be to achieve an optimal weight and to maintain that weight once it is achieved 

### Goals must be measurable and specific 

- If you have a goal to be more patient, count how many times you raise your voice in a day. If the numbers drop, your patience is increasing.

> Definite goals produce definite results -- Paul J. Meyer

- Goals are best state in units of measurement that don't change 
- Goals are measured in real things, everybody knows the score. 
  - When the points go up on an football scoreboard, everybody knows what is happening, who is ahead, and who is catching up or widening their lead. 
- Goals must be measured in something you can see. Percentages are too vage. 

### Goals must allow for personality changes 

- You must change 
- If you double your income next year, how will you spend it ? Where will you put it ? Unless you've got someplace for it to go there is no reason to do it or make it. 
- The reason most of us don't make more money than we do right now is because we don't know what we would do if we had it. It sounds odd, but it's true 

### Goals must contain an interrelated statement of benefits

- Goals and benefits go together. The accronym WIIFM stands for "What's in it for me". Make sure you've got some WIIFM in your goals program. 
- WIIFM explains the why to people. Everybody, when asked to do something unusual or out of the ordinary, wants to know why
They are not interessed in the how 
- If we can clearly defined the why, then we will have the king of performance we want and the how will pretty much take care of itself.
- The why is in sports is apparen. You wouldn't think of going on a basketball court except to win. 
- The why also needs to be in personal, business and volunteer activities.
